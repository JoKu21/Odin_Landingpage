# Odin_Landingpage - created by joku.dev

This Landingpage is the final exercise of the foundations chapter "Flexbox" within theOdinProject.
As inspiration, I use the given examples from the original website: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page .
In addition, those tips were givin:
- font-family: roboto
- work on 1 section at a time
- 4 main sections + footer
- start with html and afterwords start with css
- a lot of the parts within this final project were parts of the "Flexbox"-lecture
- don't focus on responsive design (you'll learn it later)
- use good commentation and manage your git
